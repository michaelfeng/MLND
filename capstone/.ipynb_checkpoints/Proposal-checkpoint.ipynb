    "### Education Data Mining Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of universities are currently using Artificial Intelligent Tutoring systems. These systems are used to tutoring students on some courses. Students can acquired knowledge from remote and anytime they want. The time and hours students spend on the system are valuable for both students and universities. Analysis of these behaviors can be a good practice, so that Universities can use students’ behaviors on tutoring system to optimize their tutoring systems and exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "Carnegie Learning systems[1] are mainly focusing on transforming math classroom to both students and teachers. A course on Carnegie Learning system tutoring algebra deployed 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. It's used to tutoring Algebra knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a scientific viewpoint, the ability to achieve low prediction error on unseen data is evidence that the learner has accurately discovered the underlying factors which make items easier or harder for students. Knowing these factors is essential for the design of high-quality curricula and lesson plans (both for human instructors and for automated tutoring software). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, improved models could be saving millions of hours of students' time (and effort) in learning. And we have the potential to influence lesson design, improving retention, increasing student engagement, reducing wasted time, and increasing transfer to future lessons."

    "## Domain Background\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutoring systems design to guide students and teachers the way to better learning mathematics. They are now in use in more than 2,500 schools across the US for some 500,000 students per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model which accurately predicts long-term future performance as a byproduct of day-to-day tutoring could augment or replace some current standardized tests from the goal of assessing performance while simultaneously assisting learning. Previous work has suggested that these analyses and improvements is indeed possible: e.g., an appropriate analysis of 8th-grade tutoring logs can predict 10th-grade standardized test performance as well as 8th-grade standardized test results can predict 10th-grade standardized test performance (Feng, Heffernan, & Koedinger, 2009)[2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiment and data mining may provide insights that allow important improvements in optimization Artificial Intelligent Tutoring Systems. We are gonna to predict student first correct attempt probabilities on problems from logs of student interaction with the Carnegie Learning Algebra System data. \n",
    "Currently, I’m applying a MCS of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Some university courses may later be taken online with some tutoring systems. In personally, I think it’s really important and valuable for all kinds of students and universities to know some interesting insights of these tutoring systems."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminologies referred in our proposal are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step: an observable part of the solution to a problem. \n",
    "- Transaction: students' interaction with tutoring system. For e.g., hint request, incorrect attempt, or correct attempt. Every transaction is referred to as an attempt for a step.\n",
    "- Solution: All steps comprises to figure problem out.\n",
    "- Problem: A task for a student to perform that typically involves multiple steps.\n",
    "- Answer: A final step to one problem\n",
    "- Knowledge Component(KC): A piece of knowledge or information could be used to accomplish a problem. A KC is associated with one or more steps. Also one or more KC can be associated with one step.\n",
    "- Opportunity: A chance for student, representing he or she has acquired of the KC that are needed to accomplish a problem.\n",
    "- Opportunity count: Steps(contains KC) count for student that are needed to solve a problem. So, student can have multi chances to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The students solve problems in the tutor and each interaction between the student and computer is logged as a transaction. Our data are records of transactions(which we've mention before). \n",
    "\n",
    "A record is a step summary of all of a given student's attempts info for given exercise problem. Training data are records of different students's transactions on different exercises problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, We are gonna use thousands of student-record (a record of a student working on a step) to predict students' correct first attempt on problems. CFA(Correct First Attempt): a binary number, which is 0 or 1. A CFA value indicates the result of a student's correct first attempt on one problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability values of different students' first correct attempt on different problems are going to be predicted as our final prediction result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFA is 0 or 1 makes the problem likely to be a classification problem. In order to calculate [log loss](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html), we need to output the probability of CFA equals to 1 for students on problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability can be calculated by sklearn. We can find some models or methods at [Sklearn Home](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [sklearn.svm.libsvm.predict_proba](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.libsvm.predict_proba.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can get model's performance metric like [log loss](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) on unseen data for measurement. \n"

    "#### Input data and features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data size: 8918055 records (algebra_2008_2009_train.txt)\n",
    "- Train portion of records: 0.7 x 8918055 or 0.6 x 8918055\n",

    "\n",
    "We will try different portion for performance.\n",
    "For all training data sets, each record will be a step that contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row: row number for record.\n",
    "- Anon Student Id: unique id for a student\n",
    "- Problem Hierarchy: the hierarchy of curriculum levels containing the problem.\n",
    "- Problem Name: unique identifier for one problem.\n",
    "- Problem View: the total number of times the student encountered the problem so far.\n",
    "- Step Name: each problem consists of one or more steps (e.g., \"find the area of rectangle ABCD\" or \"divide both sides of the equation by x\"). The step name is unique within each problem, but there may be collisions between different problems, so the only unique identifier for a step is the pair of problem_name and step_name.\n",
    "- Step Start Time: the starting time of the step. Can be null.\n",
    "- First Transaction Time: the time of the first transaction toward the step.\n",
    "- Correct Transaction Time: the time of the correct attempt toward the step, if there was one.\n",
    "- Step End Time: the time of the last transaction toward the step.\n",
    "- Step Duration (sec): the elapsed time of the step in seconds, calculated by adding all the duration for transactions that were attributed to the step. Can be null (if step start time is null).\n",
    "- Correct Step Duration (sec): the step duration if the first attempt for the step was correct.\n",
    "- Error Step Duration (sec): the step duration if the first attempt for the step was an error (incorrect attempt or hint request).\n",
    "- Correct First Attempt: the student's first attempt on a step — 1 if correct, 0 if an error.\n",
    "- Incorrects: total number of incorrect attempts by the student on the step.\n",
    "- Hints: total number of hints requested by the student for the step.\n",
    "- Corrects: total correct attempts by the student for the step. (Only increases if the step is encountered more than once.)\n",
    "- KC(KC Model Name): the identified skills that are used in a problem, where available. A step can have multiple KCs assigned to it. Multiple KCs for a step are separated by ~~ (two tildes). Since opportunity describes practice by knowledge component, the corresponding opportunities are similarly separated by '~~'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opportunity(KC Model Name): steps(contains KC) count for student that are needed to solve a problem. So, student can have multi chances to solve a problem. Steps with multiple KCs will have multiple opportunity numbers separated by ~~.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output 1:\n",
    "Correct First Attempt will be used as predicting target feature. Other feature gonna used to train model. \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Output  2:\n",
    "Then We will calculate every student’s CFA rate and output prediction on target feature’s probability. So, we can use to calculate [log loss](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) of model’s prediction performance on probability. \n",
